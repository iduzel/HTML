      <h3>Method</h3>
      <ol class="method-list">
        <li>
          Heat oven to 180C/160C fan/ gas 4. Line a 20 x 20cm square baking tin
          with baking parchment.
        </li>
        <li>
          Using an electric whisk, beat the butter and sugar together until
          pale, light and fluffy. Add the eggs and mix again. Add the flour,
          baking powder, lemon zest, lemon curd and milk, and mix with a wooden
          spoon until all the ingredients are thoroughly combined. Pour the
          mixture into the prepared tin and bake for 25-30 mins or until a
          skewer comes out clean.
        </li>
        <li>
          Mix the sugar and lemon juice together and pour over the hot cake.
          Leave to cool in the tin. You can eat the cake as it is, or for a
          fancy finish, try making this feather icing.
        </li>
        <li>
          Mix the icing sugar with just enough water to give a runny, but not
          watery, icing. Put a small amount of icing in a separate bowl. Add a
          few drops of the food colouring to the icing until pale yellow. Spoon
          into a disposable icing bag.
        </li>
        <li>
          Remove the cake from the tin and peel off the baking parchment. Sit
          the cake on a wire rack over a baking tray. Spread the white icing
          over the top. Pipe thin lines of the coloured icing across the width
          of the cake. Use a cocktail stick to drag through the lines in
          opposite directions to create a feathered effect. Leave to set before
          cutting into slices.
        </li>
